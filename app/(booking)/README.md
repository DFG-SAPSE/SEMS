By opting for a more shallow organizational structure, we are aiming to improve the readability and maintainability of our codebase for now. In this case, we have created a separate folder within the components directory specifically for the SearchConsultant component.

This decision was made because the SearchConsultant component has grown in size and organizing it in its own folder helps to keep related files and dependencies together. We believe this makes it easier for developers to navigate and understand the codebase.

Furthermore, the SearchConsultant component is an integral part of the user flow in the booking process. Placing it in its own folder emphasizes its importance and makes it easier to locate and modify when necessary.
